title: Getting Started
---

*Let the user know how to get started with the workflow. This should mirror the section in your README,
or the README should point them here.*

### Prerequisites

*Define the software and hardware requirements needed to run the workflow.*

The workflow requires the following software:

* **[Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/)**: Creates the environment for running the workflow.
* **Git**: Version control
* A container runtime: **Docker** (for local testing) or **Singularity/Apptainer** (recommended for HPC).

*Include expected resource usage on a typical dataset if possible, such as memory, CPU, runtime, and disk usage.*

This workflow can run on standard HPC nodes with at least 16 GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores. Typical runtime for a whole-exome sequencing sample pair is approximately 6-8 hours, depending on the dataset size and computational resources allocated.

### How to run/install

*Supply a tiny dataset for testing purposes, along with example commands to run the workflow.*

**Nextflow Example:**
```{.bash}
# Open a Pixi shell to create an environment for running the workflow.
pixi shell
# Runs a small, defined test case using pre-configured containers.
nextflow run main.nf -profile test,docker
```

**Snakemake Example:**
```{.bash}
# Runs with a minimal config file, leveraging Conda environments.
snakemake --use-conda -j 4 --configfile config/test_config.yaml
```
