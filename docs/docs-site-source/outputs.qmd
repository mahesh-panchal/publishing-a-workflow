*Describe where to find the results, which files are important, and how to interpret them.
If necessary, include case studies as subsections, or subpages.*

## Results

The results are stored in a dedicated directory on the **[Storage Platform, e.g., Network Drive, S3 Bucket]**.

* **Path:** `[Your_Root_Path]/workflow-output/[Run-ID]/`
* **Example Path:** `/project-data/workflow-output/20251127_0830/`

> **Note:** The `[Run-ID]` is generated based on the date and time the workflow started.

## Important files

*Describe which files the workflow user should focus on.*

There are two primary files you need to review after every run.

| File Name | Format | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`final_data_report.csv`** | CSV | **The official, clean output.** Contains all successfully processed records. |
| **`run_summary.json`** | JSON | **The status report.** Contains key metrics like success rate and runtime. |

## How to Interpret the Files

### A. Interpreting `run_summary.json`

Check these two values first to understand the overall run health:

| JSON Field | Meaning | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `status` | **SUCCESS** or **FAILURE** | Must be **SUCCESS** to trust the data. |
| `success_rate_percent` | Percentage of records processed correctly. | Should be **100.0%**. If less, investigate the logs. |

### B. Interpreting `final_data_report.csv`

The most critical column in the final report is the `Validation_Status`.

| Column Name | Value | Meaning | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Validation_Status` | **PASS** | The record is clean and ready to use. | **Good to go!** |
| `Validation_Status` | **FLAGGED** | The record failed a minor QC check. | Use with caution, review manual log. |
| `Validation_Status` | **FAIL** | The record was critically rejected. | **Do not use.** Contact the maintenance team. |
