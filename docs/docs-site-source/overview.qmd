*Give an overview of what your pipeline does.*

*[Mermaid flowchart diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html)
are an excellent way to communicate what your workflow does.*

```{mermaid}

    qc[Quality Control] ==> processing[Data processing]
    processing ==> analysis[Analysis]
    analysis ==> reports[Reporting]
```

*If your workflow can be used in multiple ways, Metro maps, such as those
[used across nf-core](https://nf-co.re/docs/guidelines/graphic_design/workflow_diagrams)
are an effective way to communicate those paths.*
